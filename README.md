# GregTest
GregTest will ship as a dll library and a header file. The header file can be included in a customer's test files to allow them
to link with the dll. The dll consists of a series of assertion functions, as well as a 'bool result()' function that returns true if all tests passed and false if any tests failed. Actually compiling and running the tests is the responsibility of the build system, but shipping as a dll and header should give some flexibility here. See the [GregBuild repo](https://github.com/GregoryOrd/GregBuild) for an example build system process that uses the GregTest dll.
