TODO
-----
1) Refactor TestGatherer
	1a) Split out TestFileDefinitions.h/.c and TestCaseDefinitions.h.c
2) Have TestGatherer write into the make file
3) Create a SourceFileGatherer that gather source files and writes them into the makefiles automatically
 so that they don't need to be put in there to compile everytime a new src file is added
4) Start tracking time for each test case, total time for all tests
5) Add timeout for test cases -> fail if exceeded
6) Make test file and test case definitions resource configurable.
	- Perhaps we could define these rules in an XML file, then write an XML parser to read them at runtime
	- See the structs in TestGatherer.h for determining what variable constitute these rules
	- The has special characters definition could also be a rule in this XML
