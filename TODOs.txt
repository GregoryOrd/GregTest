TODO
-----
1) Refactor isTestCaseDefinition function in TestGatherer.c
	1a) Consider creating a "LineMetrics" struct to hold all of the details such as line length,
		number of left brackets, number of right brackets, ect
2) Build TestGatherer into GregTest.dll
3) Have TestGatherer write into the make file
4) Create a SourceFileGatherer that gather source files and writes them into the makefiles automatically
 so that they don't need to be put in there to compile everytime a new src file is added
5) Start tracking time for each test case, total time for all tests
6) Add timeout for test cases -> fail if exceeded
7) Make test file and test case definitions resource configurable.
	- Perhaps we could define these rules in an XML file, then write an XML parser to read them at runtime
	- See the structs in TestGatherer.h for determining what variable constitute these rules
	- The has special characters definition could also be a rule in this XML
