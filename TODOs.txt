TODO (Some of these things belong here. Some belong in GregBuild)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start tracking time for each test case, total time for all tests
2) Add timeout for test cases -> fail if exceeded
3) Display File name as well as test case name when printing the pass/fail message inside the
  GregTest::pass and GregTest::fail functions.
