2) Add ability to skip tests
3) Add function for beforeEachTest, afterEachTest, beforeAllTests, afterAllTests
4) Change the result() function in GregTest to return an enum
    - 0 => no tests run
    - 1 => tests passed successfully
    - 2 => tests failed
5) Add ability to define a "comparator" function for comparing custom structs 
6) Start tracking time for each test case, total time for all tests
7) Add timeout for test cases -> fail if exceeded
8) Display File name as well as test case name when printing the pass/fail message inside the
  GregTest::pass and GregTest::fail functions.
